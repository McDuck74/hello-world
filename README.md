Some more information about me....

I am someone who helps people with computer problems. I install computers, I install internet connections (Wifi), I make websites in PHP and know how to use Joomla!, WordPress and the old osCommerce. I dived into the code of Joomla! and osCommerce, so those 2 I know pretty well. On top of this, I understand a lot of coding, zo I learn new coding languages very quickly.
I can make programs in PHP, VB6, .Net, C# and ordinary MS-Dos or Basic

My techniques I learned mostly by myself on the internet, but for Object Oriented Programming I certified myself at CapGemini. My experience as a certified Microsoft Professional, I learned at XCess in Leusden. 

Right now I am an art photographer for an art collector and I manage his collection. For this purpose I make programs in PHP and MySQL to manage this remotely and to show to him what art he has.
